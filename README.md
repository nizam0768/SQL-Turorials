## ‚ùì Questions & Answers

### What are the main types of SQL commands?

SQL commands are broadly classified into:

- **DDL** (**Data Definition Language**): `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`.
- **DML** (**Data Manipulation Language**): `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **DCL** (**Data Control Language**): `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
- **TCL** (**Transaction Control Language**): `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.

### What are the different categories of datatypes in SQL Server?

**üîπ Basic Question**

1. What are the different categories of datatypes in SQL Server?
   - Numeric (int, bigint, decimal, float)
   - Character/String (char, varchar, nchar, nvarchar, text)
   - Date/Time (date, datetime, smalldatetime, datetime2, time)
   - Binary (binary, varbinary, image)
   - Other (bit, uniqueidentifier, sql_variant, xml, json (in SQL 2016+))

**üîπ Numeric Types**

2. Difference between `int`, `bigint`, `smallint`, and `tinyint`?
   - `tinyint` ‚Üí 0 to 255
   - `smallint` ‚Üí ‚Äì32,768 to 32,767
   - `int` ‚Üí ‚Äì2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
   - `bigint` ‚Üí very large (¬±9 quintillion)
3. When would you use `decimal` vs `float`?
   - `decimal` (fixed precision, good for money, financial data).
   - `float` (approximate, good for scientific/engineering values).
4. What is the difference between `numeric` and `decimal`?
   - Functionally the same; both store fixed precision numbers.

**üîπ String Types**

5. Difference between `char` and `varchar`?
   - `char(n)` ‚Üí fixed-length (always takes n characters).
   - `varchar(n)` ‚Üí variable-length (saves storage).
6. Difference between `varchar` and `nvarchar`?
   - `varchar` ‚Üí stores ASCII (1 byte per character).
   - `nvarchar` ‚Üí stores Unicode (2 bytes per character). Use for multilingual data.
7. What‚Äôs the maximum size of `varchar` and `nvarchar`?
   - `varchar(n)` up to 8,000.
   - `varchar(max)` up to 2GB.
   - `nvarchar(max)` up to 1GB (because Unicode = 2 bytes).

**üîπ Date/Time Types**

8. Difference between `datetime`, `smalldatetime`, and `datetime2`?
   - `smalldatetime` ‚Üí range 1900‚Äì2079, precision to minutes.
   - `datetime` ‚Üí range 1753‚Äì9999, precision to ~3 ms.
   - `datetime2` ‚Üí larger range, higher precision (100 ns).  
9. What‚Äôs the difference between `time`, `date`, and `datetimeoffset`?
   - `time` ‚Üí stores only time.
   - `date` ‚Üí stores only date.
   - `datetimeoffset` ‚Üí includes time zone info.

**üîπ Special/Other Types**

10. What is the `bit` datatype used for?
    - Stores 0, 1, or NULL (boolean-like values).
11. What is a `uniqueidentifier`?
    - Stores a **GUID** (Globally Unique Identifier).
12. What is the difference between `xml` and `json` datatypes?
    - `xml` has its own native datatype.
    - `json` is stored as nvarchar(max) in SQL Server but has JSON functions.
13. What is `sql_variant`?
    - Can hold values of different SQL data types (except text, ntext, timestamp, etc.).

**üîπ Tricky/Advanced Questions**

14. What happens if you insert a string longer than the column size into a `varchar`?
    - Error if `ANSI_WARNINGS` is **ON**, otherwise it truncates.
15. Why would you choose `char` over `varchar`?
    - If all values have the same length (like country codes, postal codes) ‚Üí better performance.
16. What‚Äôs the difference between `money` and `decimal` for currency values?
    - `money` has fixed 4 decimal places, prone to rounding errors.
    - `decimal` is more precise (recommended for finance).
17. What datatype would you choose for storing phone numbers? Why?
    - `varchar`, not numeric ‚Üí because phone numbers may contain +, ‚Äì, spaces.

### üîë What are Keys in SQL?
A **Key** is a column (or combination of columns) in a table that is used to uniquely identify rows or establish relationships between tables.  

Keys help with:
- **Uniqueness** ‚Üí No duplicate rows where not allowed.  
- **Relationships** ‚Üí Linking tables together.  
- **Data Integrity** ‚Üí Enforcing valid, consistent data.

#### üîπ Types of Keys in SQL

1. **Primary Key**
   - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.  
   - Cannot contain `NULL` values.  
   - Only one primary key per table.  

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(100),
       Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
   );
2. **Foreign Key**
   - Establishes a relationship between two tables.
   - Refers to the Primary Key of another table.
   - Ensures referential integrity (you cannot insert a value that doesn‚Äôt exist in the parent table).
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Orders (
     OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
     EmpID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Employees(EmpID)
     );
3. **Candidate Key**
   - Columns that can qualify as a Primary Key.
   - A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is chosen as the Primary Key.
   - Example:
      - In `Employees`, both `EmpID` and `Email` could be unique ‚Üí candidate keys.
4. **Alternate Key**
   - A Candidate Key that was not chosen as the Primary Key.
   - Example: If `EmpID` is `Primary Key`, then Email becomes an Alternate Key.
5. **Composite Key**
   - A key made of two or more columns.
   - Useful when a single column cannot uniquely identify a row.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE CourseRegistrations (
     StudentID INT,
     CourseID INT,
     PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)
     );
6. **Unique Key**
   - Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
   - Unlike Primary Key, it allows one NULL (depending on DBMS).
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Users (
     UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
     Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
     );
7. **Super Key**
   - A set of one or more columns that can uniquely identify a record.
   - Every Candidate Key is a Super Key, but not every Super Key is minimal.
   - Example: `(EmpID, Name)` is a Super Key, but only `EmpID` is minimal ‚Üí Candidate Key.
